## Four contexts

Here are four contexts (called main, server, upstream, and location) which can contain directives with one or more arguments. Directives in the main context apply to everything; directives in the server context apply to a particular host/port; directives in the upstream context refer to a set of backend servers; and directives in a location context apply only to matching web locations (e.g., "/", "/images", etc.) A location context inherits from the surrounding server context, and a server context inherits from the main context. The upstream context neither inherits nor imparts its properties; it has its own special directives that donâ€™t really apply elsewhere.
